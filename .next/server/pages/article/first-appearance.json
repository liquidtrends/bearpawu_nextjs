It can also be a time to begin to look at yourself and make changes for the better. \n\nTalk to your NCSA Courtworker if you are interested in healing or _Restorative Justice Programs_. \n\nAn NCSA Courtworker is experienced in understanding: \n\n- What happened? \n- What were the circumstances that brought you to court?\n- Are there opportunities for programs, support, or healing?\n\n**Even if you’ve been charged with a crime, you still matter**. You are a human being. People make mistakes and you still have choices.  \n\nIt is also important to understand that as Indigenous people, due to Canada’s history of colonization and racism, we all suffer from some level of trauma in our lives. \n\nIssues like mental health, violence and addictions bring our people to court every day. \n\nMany of these issues in our community are a direct result of colonization and the residential school system. Children were removed from their parents and inter-generational cycles of trauma and cultural genocide occurred. Watch **NCSA’s Documentary Home Fire** to learn more.\n\nFor over 50 years, NCSA has been helping Indigenous people in court and supporting them in their healing journey. NCSA Courtworkers are guided by the **NCSA’s Model of Resilience** and its foundation of:\n- Self Determination\n- Relationships\n- Connectedness\n\n","imagePosition":null,"sectionImages":{"data":{"id":39,"attributes":{"name":"MicrosoftTeams-image (6).png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":2145,"height":1265,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_MicrosoftTeams-image (6).png","hash":"thumbnail_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":245,"height":144,"size":39.98,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57.png"},"small":{"name":"small_MicrosoftTeams-image (6).png","hash":"small_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":500,"height":295,"size":110.12,"url":"/uploads/small_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_MicrosoftTeams-image (6).png","hash":"medium_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":750,"height":442,"size":196.4,"url":"/uploads/medium_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57.png"},"large":{"name":"large_MicrosoftTeams-image (6).png","hash":"large_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":1000,"height":590,"size":320.25,"url":"/uploads/large_Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57.png"}},"hash":"Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":183.06,"url":"/uploads/Microsoft_Teams_image_6_e55a0a2e57.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-08-28T19:26:57.154Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-28T19:26:57.154Z"}}},"sectionVideo":{"data":null}},{"id":22,"__component":"shared.course-content","sectionTitle":"Restorative Justice","sectionContent":"There are many different **Restorative Justice Programs** available across the province.
