An NCSA Courtworker may be able to get your traffic ticket lowered or even thrown out.  Contact them beforehand to arrange a meeting. 
There are some serious criminal charges, called Indictable Offenses, that an NCSA Courtworker may not be able appear with you for.  However, they can help connect you with a Duty Counsel Lawyer or provide support in Applying for Legal Aid.

It can also be a time to begin to look at yourself and make changes for the better.</p>
<p>Talk to your NCSA Courtworker if you are interested in healing or <em>Restorative Justice Programs</em>.</p>
<p>An NCSA Courtworker is experienced in understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>What were the circumstances that brought you to court?</li>
<li>Are there opportunities for programs, support, or healing?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Even if you’ve been charged with a crime, you still matter</strong>. You are a human being. People make mistakes and you still have choices.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand that as Indigenous people, due to Canada’s history of colonization and racism, we all suffer from some level of trauma in our lives.</p>
<p>Issues like mental health, violence and addictions bring our people to court every day.</p>
<p>Many of these issues in our community are a direct result of colonization and the residential school system. Children were removed from their parents and inter-generational cycles of trauma and cultural genocide occurred. Watch <strong>NCSA’s Documentary Home Fire</strong> to learn more.</p>
<p>For over 50 years, NCSA has been helping Indigenous people in court and supporting them in their healing journey. NCSA Courtworkers are guided by the <strong>NCSA’s Model of Resilience</strong> and its foundation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self Determination</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Connectedness</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Restorative Justice</h2><img class="pt-10 w-full"/><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"><p>There are many different <strong>Restorative Justice Programs</strong> available across the province. These programs may also be known as Alternative Measures or Extra Judicial Sanctions.</p>
<p>These programs may include Indigenous processes that bring the victim and offender together to learn about impacts of the crime, consequences, and healing going forward.</p>
<p>The Crown Prosecutor and the Judge would have to agree to <em>divert your case away from court</em> and into a <em>Restorative Justice Program</em>.  Often, if you successfully complete the program, charges may be dropped, a criminal record avoided, and healing on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Contact an NCSA Courtworker</strong> to see if you are a good candidate for a Restorative Justice Program.</p></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900"></h2><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900"></h2><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900"></h2><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900"></h2><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"></div></div><div class="bg-[#155A63] p-6 relative z-50 rounded-xl"><div class="text-white text-center transition-[padding] duration-500 ease absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-0 overflow-hidden rounded-tl-xl rounded-tr-xl false  bg-green-500"></div><div class=""><span class="text-gray-300 text-2xl">Question <!-- -->1</span><span class="text-gray-500">/<!-- -->4</span></div><hr class="my-3"/><div class="text-white my-5 text-2xl">1.
