There is no 24 or 72-hour waiting period. You can call anytime. You don’t have to be a family member or even live in the same city.</p>
<p>If a person is under 12, elderly, or has  disabilities, call 911 immediately.</p>
<p>For someone to be missing, it would mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have not been in contact with people they normally are</li>
<li>They are absent from the places they usually are</li>
<li>Their location is unknown despite reasonable efforts to locate them</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone you know is missing, it is very important to reach out for support. A support can be an Elder, family member, friend, or advocate.</p>
<p>Cultural practices like smudging and ceremony can balance us during difficult times. Exercise and going for walks helps with stress too.

<p>You’ll be asked questions such as physical description, health, lifestyle, and circumstances.</p>
<p>Police may also ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last person spoken to or seen with</li>
<li>Is this behavior out of character?</li>
<li>On medication or immediate health concerns?</li>
<li>Addictions issues?</li>
<li>Suicidal?</li>

In families and communities, there remains a distrust of the police based on Canada’s history of colonization.</p>
<p>This continued distrust can prevent people from making a report, or if they do, they hold back information.</p>
<p>This distrust goes back generations to the times of residential school, when it was the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) who often took children away.</p>
<p>And it was the police, who years later, were taking our kids to the child welfare system.</p>
<p>And, it was the police, who apologized to the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women after a national inquiry:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>“I’m sorry that for too many of you, the RCMP was not the police service that it needed to be during this terrible time in your life. It is very clear to me that the RCMP could have done better and I promise to you we will do better.&quot;</em>
RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, 2018</p>
<p>In order to find a missing person, try to build a trusting relationship with the police officers at your local station or detachment.</p></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">In FACT</h2><img class="pt-10 w-full"/><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"><p>In 2011, the RCMP themselves released a report titled &quot;The Role of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police during the Indian Residential School system&quot;.</p>
<p>Some of the report&#x27;s findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a lack of trust between Indigenous Peoples and the RCMP</li>
<li>The RCMP were used as a threat against parents to get the children to go to school</li>
<li>The threat of police action by Indian Agents and church officials was used to obtain compliance from Indigenous people</li>
<li>Many former students claimed they learned to fear the RCMP. As a result, many people didn&#x27;t try to contact police</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as you can see, picking up the phone sometimes is not so easy.</p></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">A National Inquiry</h2><img class="pt-10 w-full" src="http://localhost:1337/uploads/Justice_Image_e0c7777e15.png"/><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"><p>Want to know what the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women said about the relationship between the police and the community? Here is a small section from the Inquiry’s Calls for Justice:</p>
<p>When the unthinkable happens and families become concerned that their loved one may be missing or in danger of violence, they are faced with a difficult dilemma:</p>
<ul>
<li>to seek help in finding that loved one requires reaching out to institutions (police) that have historically ignored and continue to ignore their concerns</li>
<li>forced to reach out to institutions that are directly at the heart of significant pain, division, cultural destruction, and trauma experienced in their family and perhaps by the loved one they seek help in finding</li>
<li>If families do reach out to the police or another representative of the criminal justice system, they are often confronted with an individual, policy, procedure, or way of relating that shows little to no awareness or understanding of the histories of and complexities in the relationship between Indigenous Peoples and the police</li>
<li>Instead, within this institution, the family and their lost loved one are viewed through a lens of pervasive racist and sexist stereotypes</li>
<li>This stereotyping and mistrust creates a reluctance to reach out to the police for help</li>
<li>On a much larger scale, the historic denial of and unwillingness to investigate the disappearances or deaths of many Indigenous people have, for many years, sent the message that the police are indifferent to such violence</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Police Investigation</h2><img class="pt-10 w-full" src="http://localhost:1337/uploads/Police_Investigation_d49cd2af6d.png"/><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"><p>When police in Alberta receive a missing persons report, they assess the report based on a number of vulnerability factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>physical health</li>
<li>mental health and competency</li>
<li>emotional state</li>
<li>lifestyle factors</li>
<li>circumstances</li>
<li>prior involvement with police</li>
<li>environmental conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>A missing person is considered high risk if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alzheimer patient/wanderer</li>
<li>Over 80 years of age</li>
<li>12 years of age and younger</li>
<li>A victim or witness in recent or future court proceedings</li>
<li>Suicidal</li>
<li>Involved in suspicious circumstances</li>
<li>A person who is endangered due to mental health concerns</li>
</ul>
<p>Missing people are considered missing until located. The case will only be closed once the person has been found.</p>
<p>Open files are reviewed periodically, at minimum – at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and every 2 years after.</p>
<h1>Contact with police and support</h1>
<p>The Primary Investigator at the Missing Persons Unit is the families main contact with the police. They can give you advice and help you understand the investigation.</p>
<p>The Alberta Victims Services Family Liaison Unit provide supports to families of missing Indigenous people. They can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with police</li>
<li>Decide which actions to take</li>
<li>Cope through the process</li>
</ul>
<p>Family Information Liaison Unit: 780-427-3460 or toll free 310-0000</p></div></div><div class="mt-12 space-y-4"><hr/><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Moving Forward</h2><img class="pt-10 w-full" src="http://localhost:1337/uploads/Moving_Forward_774b414a46.png"/><div class="contentBlock text-lg space-y-8"><p>Write everything down. Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information for the police officers you speak to</li>
<li>Detailed notes with dates</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a computer person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder on your desktop to save all your files in</li>
<li>Organize emails into a specific folder in your email</li>
</ul>
<p>--</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can phone your investigator if you would like an update. Keep in mind that in order to protect the integrity of the investigation, the police may not be able to tell you everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you start to get information from people on social media – screenshot those conversations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What if a file isn’t opened?</h1>
<p>If the police do not open a file right away, call the police again:</p>
<ul>
<li>If new information becomes available</li>
<li>If the person remains missing for a longer period of time</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you may feel the police are not working in a manner you are happy with and you would like to make a complaint about the investigator.</p>
<p>Before you do that, take the time to speak to their supervisor or the head of
their unit or section.</p>
